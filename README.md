Track what you and your friends are eating.

## Development

Check [development.md](./development.md).

## Deploy

Check `.env.example`

```sh
DB_URL=
GH_CLIENT_ID=
GH_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

You can get `GH_CLIENT_SECRET` and `GH_CLIENT_ID` by creating a [GitHub Application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

`DB_URL` is from [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com), but any MySQL URL would work.
